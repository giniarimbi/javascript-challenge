# Javascript Challenge

# Web Scraping



### 1. Background 

**Project Background:** In this javascript project, we will filter UFO data from `data.js` and put several search filter. 


### 2. Methodology 

**Methodology:** We will use Javascript and D3 work on this challenge. 

* UFO Level 1
First, we read UFO data from `data.js` which consists of the following properties: 
date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments. 

Then, we connect the input box from html files and put filter function. The result is then populated back in the html. For this part, 
our search criteria is only the datetime. 

* UFO Level 2
We expand the search criteria. Instead of having 1 input column, we add multiple search columns based on UFO data properties.
